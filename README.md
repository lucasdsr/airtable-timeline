# airtable-timeline

This project is an Timeline implementation challenge proposed by Airtable.

### Technologies

It is build in _Typescript_ using _React_ and [_MUI components_](https://mui.com/material-ui/all-components/).

### Features

- **Type safe** implementation with Typescript
- **Well-separated** and self-described components
- **Responsiveness**, this timeline have basic responsiveness to render well on all the devices
- **Vite converted**, in the beginig the **build tool** used was Parcel, i decided to move to Vite due to some lazy building and problems to find packages.
- **Styled separation** by component.

### Conversation

This implementation was made in less than 4 hours of code, including the TypeScript addition and the build tool change.
If I had more time, this time would be dedicated to a more attractive design, building a better UI/UX interface.
I would implement the additional features suggested in the instructions file, and maybe create a timeline management feature too, allowing the user to create and manage different timelines, events, and move the events and timelines themselves.

My error in this code was dedicating too much time to the project's base. I could have gotten a better balance between configuring a solid base and building an attractive design.
